# thepsp.org

This is a single page React app I built for my brother-in-law's non-profit organization using Google Cloud infrastructure.

It features a simple content-management system and cycles through almost eight thousands of legislators on the federal and state level, generating unique images and sending out daily social media posts in each of the 50 US States.

It was interesting using Cloud Functions to build back-end features instead of doing that work in one or more server-side applications.
